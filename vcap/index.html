<h2>Narrative</h2 style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>
    (This section is also on the VCAP site request form)
</em></p>

<p>
    While the southern half of my property is a lovely, well-draining lawn and 
    garden, the northern half experiences runoff problems after every rain 
    event, which has led to poor vegetation and slight erosion. Runoff from both
    a neighbor's parcel and my property flow into an impervious driveway, 
    instead of infiltrating the ground. It essentially becomes a muddy river 
    when it rains heavily. That water flows into a storm drain about fifty feet
    away, which often gets overwhelmed and flooded.
</p>

<p>
    I've tried previous mitigation strategies by creating berms along the border
    with the neighbor's to promote infiltration. To address my resource 
    concerns, I would like to establish a several rain gardens surrounding my 
    driveway, to absorb the storm water and correct the poor vegetation.
</p>

<p class="break">
    I would also like to add rainwater harvesting to limit the muddy runoff. The
    collected water would be excellent for the existing and proposed gardens on
    my parcel. I hope to convert half of my turf backyard and sideyard to
    conservation landscaping using native plants such as Fothergilla, 
    Eutrochium, and Asclepias, which would create a pollinator habitat.

<p>
    Storm runoff drains into the north section of my front yard which has poor
    vegetation and infiltration, before flowing into my driveway. Introducting a
    rain garden here would mitigate that pool of water.

<p class="break">
    The neighbor's lawn slopes towards my property. Runoff flows into my 
    driveway without much infiltration on her side. This patch of land between 
    along that border often gets flooded, leading to slight erosion and poor 
    vegetion. Adding rain garden to could address these resource concerns.

<p>
    The storm drain on northeast side of the house causes poor vegetation and 
    eventually just flows into the driveway. This area of the side lawn is 
    an ideal place for a new rain garden.

<p class="break">
    At one point on the border, I built a berm to encourage water infiltration 
    on the neighbor's side. The muddy water in the foreground is runoff caused 
    by my house's storm drains. (This area is not part of the VCAP application.)

<p>
    I'd like to capture the storm runoff from the western side of my house, via
    rainwater harvesting. Converting the much of the turf backyard to 
    conservation landscaping would be more beneficial for the environment.
