    Storm runoff drains into a section of my front yard which has poor
    vegetation and infiltration, before flowing into my driveway. Introducting a
    rain garden here would reduce the muddy runoff.

    The neighbor's lawn slopes towards my property. Runoff flows into my 
    driveway without much infiltration on her side. This patch of land between 
    along that border often gets flooded, leading to slight erosion and poor 
    vegetion. Adding rain garden to could address these resource concerns.

<p>
    At one point on the border, I built a berm to encourage water infiltration 
    on the neighbor's side. The muddy water in the foreground is runoff caused 
    by my house's storm drains. (This area is not part of the VCAP application.)

    The storm drain on northeast side of the house causes poor vegetation and 
    eventually just flows into the driveway. This area of the side lawn is 
    an ideal place for a new rain garden.

<p>
    I'd like to capture the storm runoff from the western side of my house, via
    rainwater harvesting. Converting the much of the turf backyard to 
    conservation landscaping would be more beneficial for the environment.

<p>
    The southern part of the property is a well-drained, lovely turf lawn and 
    garden. The north part of the lawn show how runoff from both the neighbor's
    parcel and my property flow into an impervious driveway before exiting to 
    the road. Hopefully, surrounding the driveway with rain gardens will 
    mitigate some of poor infiltration and vegetation resource concerns. The 
    proposed location for rainwater harvesting on the northwest side of the 
    house. Half of the side lawn and back yard would converted conservation 
    landscaping.
