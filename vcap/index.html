<p>Storm runoff drains into a section of my front yard which has poor vegetation, and eventually flows into my driveway. The proposal here is a rain garden and potentially a rain barrel reduce the muddy runoff.</p>

<p>My neighbor's lawn slopes towards my property and will drain into my property without infiltrating on her side. There's a patch of land between my driveway and the fence that often gets flooded as seen, leading to slight erosion and poor vegetion. The proposal is add a rain garden to address these resource concerns.</p>

<p>Here is another area where storm runoff from neighbor's property drains into my property. I built up a berm to encourage water infiltration on the neighbor's side. The muddy water in the foreground is runoff from my house's storm drains. (This area is not part of the VCAP application.)</p>
