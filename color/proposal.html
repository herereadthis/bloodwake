<h1>Proposal: Color</h1>
<p>By Jimmy Ha</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to create images dominated by color. I hope to create pictures where the main attention (or distraction) is around color, instead of composition or themes or subject matter. I believe this approach will broaden my skills in taking pictures, as it is a complete departure from much of my previous work, which was black and white photography.<p>

<h2>Plan</h2>

<p>I don't want to completely abandon the previous work I was doing in the Renaissance series, but that project was very strictly constrained by composition. I still want to take pictures of people in costume in interesting environments, but this time I want to consider the color of every element on the subject and background.</p>

<h2>Color Can Establish Mood</h2>

<p>I want to find ways to use a dominant color in a photo to build emotion. If the image is to be calming, then blue and violet colors are ideal. If the story is meant to be energetic, then orange and red tones would work best.</p>

<p>Kandinsky's painting is his reaction to hearing a concert by Arnold Schoenberg. The discordance of the music is repesent as the color yellow.</p>

<p>Here are some emotions commonly associated with certain colors. Obviously, they are not universal when considering the culture and background of different individuals.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Black</strong> - power, grief, evil</li>
    <li><strong>White</strong> - purity, cleanliness, innocence</li>
    <li><strong>Red</strong> - anger, aggressiveness, love</li>
    <li><strong>Yelow</strong> - happiness, optimism</li>
    <li><strong>Blue</strong> - calm, tranquiltiy</li>
    <li><strong>Green</strong> - nature, growth, harmony</li>
    <li><strong>Orange</strong> - fun, energy</li>
    <li><strong>Purple</strong> - royalty, wealth</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>No other background could create the mood for Nan Goldin's self-portrait besides this sickly green. However, it is worth noting that the green of the background is most likely an unnatural color caused by improper white balance. Therefore, where there lack of proper emotion, we can artificially create the one we need.</p>

<h2>Color Can Define Contrast</h2>

</figure>

<p>The best representation of what I hope to achieve are the massive paintings by Mark Rothko which are purely about color. His paintings are completely devoid of form and and subject matter. What really remains is how we react to the colors themselves. In this painting, the low contrast between the colors helps achieve a calming reaction.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to explore are color harmonies. I'll start with a key color (the main color of attention) in the picture, and choose other colors accordingly. What I must consider is that certain color color combinations create different connotations. I can use this to advantage if I want to challenge or strengthen the meaning of a picture. For example, red and blue conjures patriotism; these memories can then form part of a narrative of a politically-focused picture.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>There are five types of harmonies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><span><strong>Direct</strong> - this basic harmony is using the key color's direct opposite. It is often full of tension and dynamicism.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Red and green form Christmas colors</li>
            <li>Blue and orange are often contrast colors used in action movies</li>
        </ul>    
    </li>
    <li><span><strong>Split Complementary</strong> - this harmony takes the colors on other side of the key color's direct opposite. Monet's <em>The Houses of Parliament in London</em> uses amber as the key color, and blue and purple as the split complements.</span>

        </figure>
    </li>
    <li><span><strong>Triadic</strong> - this harmony uses three equally spaced colors.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Red, blue, and yellow form the primary triad, notably in the abstract art by Piet Mondrian.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span><strong>Analagous</strong> - this harmony takes the colors adjacent to the key color, and often creates a calming effect, as seen in the previous Rothko painting</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Tetradic</strong> - this harmony takes colors at four equal distances on the color wheel. I think this harmony is too complicated so I won't explore it.</span></li>
</ul>
