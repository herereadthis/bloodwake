<h1>Proposal: Color</h1>
<p>By Jimmy Ha</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to create images dominated by color. I hope to create pictures where the main attention (or distraction) is around color, instead of composition or themes or subject matter. I believe this approach will broaden my skills in taking pictures, as it is a complete departure from much of my previous work, which was black and white photography. Judging color alone as the merit of a picture seems to be missing from much of the critiquing in which I participate, or read.<p>

<h2>Color Establishes Mood</h2>

<p>I want to find ways to use a dominant color in a photo to build emotion. If the story is meant to be energetic, then orange and red tones would work best.</p>

    <figcaption>"Impression III" - Wassily Kaninsky (1911)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Kandinsky's painting is his reaction to hearing a concert by Arnold Schoenberg. The discordance of the music is repesent as the color yellow.</p>

    <figcaption>"One Month After Being Battered" - Nan Goldin (1984)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No other background could create the mood for Nan Goldin's self-portrait besides this sickly green. However, it is worth noting that the green of the background is most likely an unnatural color caused by improper white balance. Therefore, where there lack of proper emotion, we can artificially create the one we need.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Black</strong> - power, grief, evil</li>
    <li><strong>White</strong> - purity, cleanliness, innocence</li>
    <li><strong>Red</strong> - anger, aggressiveness, love</li>
    <li><strong>Yelow</strong> - happiness, optimism</li>
    <li><strong>Blue</strong> - calm, tranquiltiy</li>
    <li><strong>Green</strong> - nature, growth, harmony</li>
    <li><strong>Orange</strong> - fun, energy</li>
    <li><strong>Purple</strong> - royalty, wealth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Color Defines Contrast</h2>

<p>The best representation of what I hope to achieve are the massive paintings by Mark Rothko which are purely about color. His paintings are completely devoid of form and and subject matter. What really remains is how we react to the colors themselves. It is interesting to see how different combinations fo colors create a particular reaction.</p>
