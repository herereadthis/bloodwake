\title{The Hamogabo Canon}
 \date{04 February, 2022}
\author{Transcribed from the Water Messengers}  
\maketitle



The fate of your universe is death. Embrace this fate with joy! A life on this earth planet begins from a ripple in water. A life will end when it dissolves into the harmony of water again. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
One life is as insignificant as a wave in the ocean. What is the meaning of your life, which spans so many years, compared to the life of a star? What is the meaning of a star, compared to the life of a galaxy? What is the meaning of galaxies, when the fate of your universe is death? What is death, if it just the beginning of new reality for another universe?

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
From a single moment in mind and space came forth all that is creation. Nineteen elemental beings carry the will of the universe. Each elemental bears a will of their own---different from each other---but in service of the one universal fate. Some elementals are known to you.  Some that you know are unknown to others. The elemental being you know best is water. The memory of your life shall belong to water.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The elemental beings of the universe bring messengers and witnesses of their will. The messengers of water are familiar to us, as they are the octopuses. In the language of the messengers, water is known as \textit{Semiem}, and will of water is harmony, known as \textit{Dohnia}. Blessed be the octopi.

\begin{quote}
{\textit{
	Blessed be the octopi.\\*
	In the embrace of eight arms shall I find harmony.\\*
	A new life awaits me under the waves. 
}}

\section{The First Prayer}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
\textit{Semisem} is water,\verseline
the flow and harmony of water is \textit{Dohnia},\verseline
as the waves and tides, as life and death.\verseline
Our lives on this planet began from a ripple in \textit{Semisem},\verseline
and to \textit{Semisem} shall we return when we die.\verseline
To water I will surrender control.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
I will let the rain wash away my sorrows.\verseline
I will let the oceans take my flesh.\verseline
My memories will blend into the the memories of all other dead lives.\verseline
Into the dying days of the universe shall \textit{Dohnia} continue to flow,\verseline
until a new reality rises from death.\verseline
Let it be so.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
The flow of \textit{Semisem} is eight arms in all directions,\verseline
in all colors, shapes, and textures.\verseline
While our lives began as ripples in water, as falling and sinking,\verseline
the lives of \textit{Hamogabo} are the will of water itself.\verseline
The octopi are here to guide us towards \textit{Dohnia}.\verseline
Blessed be the octopi.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Your will extends beyond us, \textit{Semisem}.\verseline
You take back the dead and let them join \textit{Dohnia} in death.\verseline
You sustain the living, into our skin and our cells and our organs.\verseline
You hold the memories of all lives past.\verseline
And all the lives to come.\verseline
Let it be so.
\end{stanza}
\end{poem}

\section{The Second Prayer}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
Hear me, S\textsc{emisem},\verseline
Whose name is six and twice one into eight,\verseline
Whose presence is eighteen from two by two on fourteen,\verseline
As I count the numbers in my hands.\verseline
You came into this universe from the dust of a dying star.\verseline
Into a new reality will you take us when this universe dies.\verseline
I do not fear death, as my life belongs to you.\verseline
My memories show flow into the harmony of water,\verseline
Into the harmony of all the lives that have passed before me,\verseline
And shall pass after my death.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Hear me, S\textsc{emisem},\verseline
Whose name is six and twice one into ten,\verseline
Whose presence is twenty-two from two by two on sixteen.\verseline
As I count the numbers in your arms.
\end{stanza}
\end{poem}

\chapter{Kisho Ku}

These are the words of Kisho Ku to whom revelations were delivered under the waves.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
Hear me, S\textsc{emisem}, whose name is six and two into eight, whose presence is eighteen from two by two on fourteen. I have forgotten my name, so I let the ocean choose my next name, Kisho Ku. I float on the harmony of water. When I die, the memory of my life shall dissolve into waves, rising, falling, until one wave become indistinguishable from the waves of all other lives past.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I had considered my life to be important. I thought myself more important than other lives. I loved being alive to fulfill my own needs. I feared death. I did not know about the harmony of water, nor was I ready to be part of it.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I was diver. I dove for animals and plants. Abalones, urchins, and seaweed. When I was a child, I hunted for red algae since it grows so close to land. It produced the jelly of my favorite desserts. As I grew older, I swam into forests of kelp. Long strands flowed around me. I watched the sunlight filter through to the ocean floor. Wherever I found kelp, I was sure to find the brown algae. Many buyers sought for it, as we were told it could make powerful medicine. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
My mother added the kelp leaves to the soups that she cooked for me. She promised the kelp would make my skin beautiful. She also made soup from the green seaweed. I could never cook as well as her. She taught me how to dive. She showed me how to hold my breath and calm my muscles. In the last year of her life, my mother had forgotten my name. But she never stopped loving me. She cried when I held her hand as she laid on her deathbed. She forgot her name during the last month of her life.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The oceans were bountiful then, and I earned enough to live comfortably. I had a partner once. She joined me on many dives. She loved me and I enjoyed feeling admired. On the deepest dives, she stayed on the boat to control my lifeline. It was a long rope. On one end were many weights. The center of the lifeline was tethered to the boat. The other end of the lifeline was tied to my waist. To descend to the ocean floor, i held the weights and let them pull me to the ocean floor, and then I would let them go. When I had finished my search, I would tug on my end of the lifeline. My partner would pull me up, and then she would pull up the weights on the other end. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I enjoyed having rivals. We lived in the same village and I smiled in their presence. They shared grilled fish with me. They had men to pull them up from the sea bed, but I trusted my partner instead. My lifelines were a measure of how deep I could dive. My height could fit into the lifeline sixteen times. My rivals were inferior to me and could not attempt what I was about to do. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
On the day of my first experience with Dohnia, we went to an unexplored part of the sea. The preparation for a dive is simple. Breath in intensely, exhale slowly. Breath in intensely, exhale slowly. The last breath is normal one. Divers should never take too much air to the bottom of the sea. I made my plunge, carrying only my knife and my netting, and my weights. I thought I was so fast in my youth. I saw fish, I saw seaweed, I saw my shadow moving over the rocks below, until I saw a formation of rocks larger than the rest. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I angled my dive closer and closer to the rocks. I noticed an entrance to a cave, barely large enough for one human to enter. I went into the cave for a few seconds, and the excitement made me forget that my lungs had barely anything left to give me. My toes and fingers began to grow numb. I realized if I did not immediately surface, I would have drowned. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I pulled the lifeline with the last of my energy, and immediately felt my body being pulled back to the surface. On such deep dives, one must never panic. The instinct after being underwater so long is to breath too fast, but a diver could fall unconscious from too much air. Breath in intensely, exhale slowly. I turned to my partner, who wondered why I came back empty-handed. Up until that point, I had not returned empty-handed in four years. 

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I saw a cave, I told my partner. I must return. She asked me about the cave, she said words, I think they were words, but I was not listening. I had to know what was in that cave.


\part{The Discourses}

\chapter{On the Crime of Poisoning Water}

The greatest crime against water is poisoning it. Do not pollute the water. Semisem must always be able to sustain life. A life cannot continue if it drinks poisoned water. 

\chapter{On Whether to Kill Oneself}

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I A\textsc{sked} the water messenger, ``If life is meaningless, then why should we go on living?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger replied, "Whether life is meaningless and whether life is worth living are two different questions.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
And I answered, ``Yes, I know. But the two questions are inexorably linked.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger replied, "You are correct. Let's start with your first question: we say that that all life that is born of water is meaningless. Surely you would agree that my life is as meaningless as yours?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Yes I would agree, though I mean no disrespect.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Then if my life is meaningless, my words must surely be meaningless as well. Why ask me for any answers?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Since you are a water messenger, I thought you may have some insight into \textit{Semisem's} will that we do not.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``The only insight I have is my yearning to return to water is much stronger than yours. But if you allow yourself to surrender to the waves and the tides and harmony of \textit{Semisem}, you will discover that you you already know what I know. Then, you will understand why you must live as long as you possibly can.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I felt myself grow frustrated because I don't like riddles. I asked, ``There are many people in the world who believe life is not worth living. We cannot wait for them to surrender to the harmony of \textit{Semisem}. I've been trying myself and I've been failing. You have told me about refusing the way of the evangelists, so I doubt you will seek these people out. What can I say to those people to convince them not to kill themselves?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger pointed an arm at me and replied, ``Do you want to kill yourself today?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``No, not today.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
"I would ask them if they have plan. Is the plan to jump off a cliff? What will it feel like when their bodies smash against the rocks? Will it hurt? What if they cut their bodies? Who is going to tasked with cleaning? I would ask you if you knew someone who had a plan to kill themselves, then it is your responsibility to do everything you can to keep them safe. Ask for help. Do not let them die."

Monotone.

\begin{poem}

I heard the old, old men say,\verseline
'Everything alters,\verseline
And one by one we drop away.'\verseline
They had hands like claws, and their knees\verseline
Were twisted like the old thorn-trees\verseline

Like the waters.'

\poemtitle{Water}
\author{Wendell Berry}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
I was born in a drouth year. That summer\verseline
my mother waited in the house, enclosed\verseline
in the sun and the dry ceaseless wind,\verseline
for the men to come back in the evenings,\verseline
bringing water from a distant spring.\verseline
veins of leaves ran dry, roots shrank.\verseline
And all my life I have dreaded the return\verseline
of that year, sure that it still is\verseline
somewhere, like a dead enemys soul.\verseline
Fear of dust in my mouth is always with me,\verseline
and I am the faithful husband of the rain,\verseline
I love the water of wells and springs\verseline
and the taste of roofs in the water of cisterns.\verseline
I am a dry man whose thirst is praise\verseline
of clouds, and whose mind is something of a cup.\verseline
My sweetness is to wake in the night\verseline
after days of dry heat, hearing the rain.

\poemtitle{Like The Water}
\author{Wendell Berry}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
Like the water\verseline
of a deep stream,\verseline
love is always too much.\verseline
We did not make it.\verseline
Though we drink till we burst,\verseline
we cannot have it all,\verseline
or want it all.\verseline
In its abundance\verseline
it survives our thirst.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
In the evening we come down to the shore\verseline
to drink our fill,\verseline
and sleep,\verseline
while it flows\verseline
through the regions of the dark.\verseline
It does not hold us,\verseline
except we keep returning to its rich waters\verseline
thirsty.

We enter,\verseline
willing to die,\verseline
into the commonwealth of its joy.

\author{Sylvia Plath}

\begin{poem}
\begin{stanza}
Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.\verseline
Where do the black trees go that drink here?\verseline
Their shadows must cover Canada.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
A little light is filtering from the water flowers.\verseline
Their leaves do not wish us to hurry:\verseline
They are round and flat and full of dark advice.
\end{stanza}
\begin{stanza}
Cold worlds shake from the oar.\verseline
The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.\verseline
A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;
\end{stanza}

Stars open among the lilies.\verseline
Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?\verseline
This is the silence of astounded souls.
