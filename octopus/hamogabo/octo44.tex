\maketitle



The fate of your universe is death. Embrace this fate with joy! A life on this planet begins from a ripple in water. A life will end when it dissolves into the flow of water again.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
One life is as insignificant as a wave in the ocean. What is the meaning of your life, which spans so many years, compared to the life of a star? What is the meaning of a star, compared to the life of a galaxy? What is the meaning of galaxies, when the fate of the universe is death?

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
From a single moment in mind and space came forth all that is creation. 16 elemental beings carry the will of the universe. Each elemental bears a will of their own---different from each other---but always an extension of the one universal fate. Some elementals are known to you.  Some that you know are unknown to others. The elemental being you know best is water, as your life came from water.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The elemental beings of the universe bring messengers and witnesses of their will. The messengers of water are familiar to us, as they are the octopuses. In the language of the messengers, water is known as \textit{Semiem}, and will of water is harmony, known as \textit{Dohnia}. Blessed be the octopi.

\begin{quote}
{\textit{
	Blessed be the octopi.\\*
	In the embrace of eight arms shall I find harmony.\\*
	A new life awaits me under the waves. 
}}

\chapter{}

\textit{Semisem} is water, the flow and harmony of water is \textit{Dohnia}, as the waves and tides, as life and death. Our lives on this planet began from a ripple in \textit{Semisem} , and to \textit{Semisem} shall we return when we die. To water I will surrender control. I will let the rain wash away troubles. I will let the oceans take my flesh. Let it be.

\chapter{On Whether to Kill Oneself}

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I asked the water messenger, ``If life is meaningless, then why should we go on living?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger replied, "Whether life is meaningless and whether life is worth living are two different questions.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
And I answered, ``Yes, I know. But the two questions are inexorably linked.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger replied, "You are correct. Let's start with your first question: we say that that all life that is born of water is meaningless. Surely you would agree that my life is as meaningless as yours?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Yes I would agree, though I mean no disrespect.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Then if my life is meaningless, my words must surely be meaningless as well. Why ask me for any answers?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``Since you are a water messenger, I thought you may have some insight into \textit{Semisem's} will that we do not.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``The only insight I have is my yearning to return to water is much stronger than yours. But if you allow yourself to surrender to the waves and the tides and harmony of \textit{Semisem}, you will discover that you you already know what I know. Then, you will understand why you must live as long as you possibly can.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
I felt myself grow frustrated because I don't like riddles. I asked, ``There are many people in the world who believe life is not worth living. We cannot wait for them to surrender to the harmony of \textit{Semisem}. I've been trying myself and I've been failing. You have told me about refusing the way of the evangelists, so I doubt you will seek these people out. What can I say to those people to convince them not to kill themselves?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
The water messenger pointed an arm at me and replied, ``Do you want to kill yourself today?''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
``No, not today.''

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
"I would ask them if they have plan. Is the plan to jump off a cliff? What will it feel like when their bodies smash against the rocks? Will it hurt? What if they cut their bodies? Who is going to tasked with cleaning? I would ask you if you knew someone who had a plan to kill themselves, then it is your responsibility to do everything you can to keep them safe. Ask for help. Do not let them die."








% A life can no more fight its fate than beaches can fight the tides. Give up control. Blessed be the octopi.
