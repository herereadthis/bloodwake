<h1>My thinking, Part III</h1>

<p>Over the past few years with my photography, I have tried to make sure that everything in my pictures exists in service to the image. In other words, I don't want anything out of place, anything accidentally disregarded, or anything that conflicts with the story I want to tell.</p>

<p>Being intentional with every aspect of a photo is actually quite fun. I think of it like a complex problem that must be solved in many steps. Does the background provide any meaningful information to help the viewer understand the something about the subject? Is there verisimilitude in the relationships between the different things in the image?</p>

<p>I found that the desire to be very intentional in photographs took on a more interesting angle if I purposely made my pictures unsettling or incongruous in some way. For example, what if I did portraits of people in bathrooms? Even for pictures without people, I still try compose them such that while everything still looks ordinary, something will still be amiss: there might be nothing to give a sense of depth, or the environment might be unusually deserted.</p>

<p>The best benefit in unsettling or uncanny picture is the viewer must take more time to understand a picture. An unsettling image should not be ambiguous because the photographer did not put in enough effort to create a stronger narrative. It should ambiguous by intention.</p>

<p>Of course I have to mention Jeff Wall, who I believe is the greatest at creating the kinds of pictures I want to make. One can intuit that every element in his pictures is there on purpose, and each thing is in service to the story. However, the story rarely every makes sense. I suppose the next question is whether Jeff Wall has a true narrative in his mind which he won't share, or he just places a bunch of disjointed clues to keep the viewers guessing.</p>

<p>For my pictures, I almost always have a "correct" interpretation for every picture. I consider it a success if the viewers can figure it out. Usually I fail at this game. There is often some detail of an image for which I forgot to account, but take the critique in some direction I did not anticipate. (My most memorable example was when I recreated the Annunciation, but since the Gabriel and Mary figures were different races, the viewers fail to see the scene and instead thought I was making a commentary on race relations.)</p>

<p>And now you know the way I approach taking pictures.</p>
