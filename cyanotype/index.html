<h1>Cyanotype Notes</h1>


<p>The following are a collection of tests and samples towards making cyanotype prints</p>

<div class="pad"></div>
<h2>Paper Selection</h2>

<p>The first problem is cyanotype chemicals are highly sensitive to alkali substances in the paper, which is typically calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate acts as a &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; for archival paper. Therefore, the best paper will be unbuffered paper. However, unbuffered paper is very rare and often expensive. A possible solution is to take buffered paper and treat it with acid. (See Appendix Part A)</p>

<h3>A. How to treat buffered papers</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Buy muriatic (hydrochloric) acid, which can be found at Ace Hardware, but not at Home Depot. Muriatic acid is for treating swimming pools. It usually comes as a 31% to 37% concentration.</li>
    <li>Hydrochloric acid is very dangerous! It has no odor. You will not be aware until your eyes and nose begin stinging. Wear rubber gloves and safety glasses.</li>
    <li>In a tray, make a 5% v/v solution. In other words for every 950mL of water, add 50mL acid.</li>
    <li>Do not add water to acid! Always add acid to water. Pour water into the tray. Then add the acid.</li>
    <li>Soak the paper in acid for 5-10 minutes. You will know it is working because the paper will start bubbling.</li>
    <li>Wash the paper in water for 10 minutes, and let it dry.</li>
    <li>Before pouring the acid away, dilute it heavily with water. Hydrochloric acid can corrode plumbing.</li>
</ul>
