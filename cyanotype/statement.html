<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p>My pictures typically show intentionality. I try to control everything in the image; things are visible because I want them to be. The background and its relationship to the subject must be in service to the narrative. I find this kind of deliberate photography appealing to me because I believe it is the photographer&rsquo;s job to show the viewer exactly what they should be seeing.</p>

<p>Printing images with alternative processes gives me an opportunity to explore something I&rsquo;ve not been able to do in the past: while an inkjet print or a silver print will show everything on the paper, something like cyanotype will only show information where the emulsion is applied. I&rsquo;m not going to give up the kind of photography I like the most, but what if I can introduce randomness which exists in service of the image?</p>

<p>For the images in this series, I chose to use cyanotype because it allows for high contrast and clarity, which become more important if parts of the image become hidden. Working with only a mental image in mind, I added chemicals to where I think information ought to exist, and in a way that echoed the subject matter.</p>

<p>Chaotic brush strokes reflect a chaotic tangle of legs. Drip marks&mdash;caused by gravity&mdash;follow strands of hair. I had only a vague idea how the images would turn out, and that was exciting.</p>

    <p>For any art form, I believe the outcome should be produced with the correct medium. Otherwise, why bother? I want to see art that is aware of its own process. I hope these images show that cyanotype was integral to narrative I want to present.</p>
