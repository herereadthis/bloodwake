<h1>My Thinking Process</h1>

<p>I will start by saying The Arnofini Portrait by Jan van Eyck is my favorite work of visual art. In one way or another, every photograph I've made (of which I'm proud) is trying to recreate this painting.</p>

<p>The amazingness of this painting is that an initial glance show nothing remarkable. Closer inspection reveals high technical mastery and unsettling ambiguity.</p>

<p>There is a mirror in the center of the painting that shows a reflection of the painter himself, and above the painting is a very large signature, "Johanes van Eyck was here. It was important to note that there was a witness to the event depicted in the painting. Is a marriage? Is it a betrothal?</p>

<p>There are so many items in the painting, each with some symbolistic meaning. The oranges and slippers and puppy signify wealth. The statue on the bedpost represents fertility. We should note that every object has been intentionally added (it is a painting, after all).</p>

<p>Perhaps the woman is actually dead and this painting is a memorial. The chandelier is uncharacteristically missing candles. There is a lit candle above the man, but a dead candle above the woman.</p>

<p>In terms of composition, the woman in green is set against red background, and this contrast of colors is highly dynamic when compared with the drab man. There is a strong sense of light direction coming from the left, which adds more dynamism. However, the subjects themselves are static and motionless. They could very well be wax statues.</p>

<p>All of these aspects creates a painting that is unsettling, at least from a modern interpretation. We want to know who these people are, what the occasion is, and what the painter's role was. There is tension in the picture between the drab and colorful parts, there is tension between the static composition and direction light, and there is tension in the overabundance of clues but no consistent interpretation.</p>

<p>Here are a few photographs I've made over the past few years.</p>
