<h1>My Thinking Process, Part Deux</h1>

<p>While my favorite photograph is "Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare" by Henri Cartier-Bresson, the actual picture from which I draw the most inspiration is the portrait of Igor Stravinsky by Arnold Newman.</p>

<p>Here six reasons why this photo appeals to me:</p>

<p>There is no actual sense of depth in this picture. Anything which implies space in this picture is inserted there by our own interpretation. Is that really a piano top, or has the shape of piano top been painted on the wall? The flatness of the scene echos the flatness of the medium.</p>

<p>The background (piano) exists entirely in service of the subject. It tells us what we need to know about the subject. This photo is an environmental portrait. Igor Stravinsky is a pianist, and his pose of being lost in thought implies he is also a composer.</p>

<p>The background, through composition, draws attention to the subject by the lines of the stick holding up the piano top, and also by the vertical lines of the wall behind him.</p>

<p>Negative space has not been wasted. It complements the other parts of the image. There seems to be an even balance of light and dark, which creates a static impression. The lines of the wall, and the top of the piano body run parallel to the frame of the photograph.</p>

<p>The walls and piano top are reduced to shapes and forms. We only see the exact amount of information the photographer intended, and nothing more. It is amazing what little we need of the piano to understand what it is.</p>

<p>All of the information is presented with clarity. I usually hate blurry or fuzzy backgrounds, unless the blurriness itself conveys information (e.g. a picture created while panning the camera, or a picture made with long exposure).</p>

<p>And here are some photographs I have created, which were inspired by Newman's portrait of Stravinsky.</p>
