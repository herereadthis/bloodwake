<h1>Proposal: Bathroom</h1>
<p>PHT 298 Fall 2018<br>
    Takashima Aya</p>

<p>When we think of words such as &ldquo;intimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;vulnerable,&rdquo; we often imagine romantic or attractive scenes. However, bathrooms are all those those things as well: they are intimate spaces because they are small, they are personal because we crave privacy when we&rsquo;re using them, and we are at out most vulnerable in a bathroom because we are often exposed and naked.</p>

<p>A consistent theme in most of my series is finding absurdity and incongruity. The incongruity of portraits in bathrooms will come from exploring the aspects of a bathroom we are most unwilling to share. I think it will be interesting to explore that sense of discomfort that people have in their own bathrooms when there is somebody else present with them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been pointed out to me that many of my pictures rely heavily on absurdist humor, and I am starting to think that I use that as a crutch. An idea is explored just a little using humor, but is never fully explored because it is not treated with seriousness.</p>

<p>This entire series was shot on medium format film. It is a medium I am comfortable working in, and it provides the opportunity to make very large prints if I choose to. For the first time, I have begun developing my own color film at home.</p>

<p>During the work I did on the Renaissance series, I used a particular framing known as single-point perspective, which means the plane of the camera is always parallel to the horizon or wall in the background. As much as possible, the elements in the photo were aligned to the center and converging lines appeared frequently. This composition style will remind the viewer of the four walls of a small enclosed space.</p>
