<h1>Proposal: Bathroom</h1>
<p>PHT 299 Spring 2019<br>
    Takashima Aya</p>

<p>When we think of words such as &ldquo;intimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;vulnerable,&rdquo; we often imagine romantic or attractive scenes. However, bathrooms are all those those things as well: they are intimate spaces because they are small, they are personal because we crave privacy when we&rsquo;re using them, and we are at out most vulnerable in a bathroom because we are often exposed and naked.</p>

<p>A consistent theme in most of my series is finding absurdity and incongruity. The incongruity of portraits in bathrooms will come from exploring the aspects of a bathroom we are most unwilling to share. I think it will be interesting to explore that sense of discomfort that people have in their own bathrooms when there is somebody else present with them.</p>

<p>As the series evolved over time, I am noticing that the pictures have less clarity. Well-lit spaces become darker, while lighting can become so intense that details are lost. Some of that effect is due to the technical limitations of medium format film, but I think obscuring some details can echo the emotions the subjects are experiencing in the pictures. However, clarity of focus is still consistent. Nothing is blurry.</p>

<p>As bathrooms are usually boring spaces with white walls, I have tried as much as possible to use colors to unite the points of interest. Blues can connot calmness while a brief spot of red can draw intense focus.</p>

<p>During the work I did on the Renaissance series, I used a particular framing known as single-point perspective, which means the plane of the camera is always parallel to the horizon or wall in the background. As much as possible, the elements in the photo were aligned to the center and converging lines appeared frequently. This composition style will remind the viewer of the four walls of a small enclosed space.</p>
