We flew on a plane, several planes. We are in an exciting new place. There are so many strange things to see and hear. Try the fried octopus! Take the 3:17 train.  If I don't take a picture of it, I might forget about it. I think our experience was unique. The other tourists we saw certainly didn't taste what we did.

It feels lonely to be surrounded by so many unfamiliar things. The vacation did not last long enough, but we miss home already. Let's do this again next year at newer and more exotic place. Somewhere where the ferns and trees are unlike the ones to which we're accustomed.

Here is my album of travel photos. Some pictures have people who live in the places where we went. For them, it's just Tuesday.  There are  buildings, flowers, tunnels that definitely belong from this vacation but not that other vacation. I remember some parts. I wonder how much I've forgotten.
